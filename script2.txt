As for your diet, it's great that you're eating high-protein foods as they can help keep you full and support muscle growth. However, to create a calorie deficit for weight loss, you might need to adjust your portion sizes or include more low-calorie, high-volume foods in your diet, like fruits and vegetables. You can also try to reduce your intake of high-fat foods, as they are very calorie-dense.

Remember, the key to weight loss is creating a sustainable calorie deficit, which means eating fewer calories than you burn. It's important to make changes that you can stick to in the long term. I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any questions![0m
